## Installation

1. Install dependencies - `npm install`

2. Create a new file `.env` if it doesn't exist and copy the contents of `env.dev` into it to be able to run your server on production environment.

3. Then you need to provide values for the configuration env files at the `src/config/env directory`.

## Running the server locally

1. Start up the server - Run `npm start` | `npm run dev`

2. Server should be running on http://localhost:5000/ by default
